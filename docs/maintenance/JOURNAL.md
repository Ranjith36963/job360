# Maintenance Journal (append-only)

## 2026-06-10 ~21:50 — bootstrap (manual, by the orchestrator)

- Created `/maintain` skill + this backlog/journal pair; loop armed every 2h.
- Context for future iterations: branch `fix/per-user-search-and-scoring-gate` carries the funnel→judge matcher (commits a925f42..d801f78 + 76f6ca7 compat fix). Live-verified: 18/18 jobs judged in 89.8s for demo user e34aeb69e9bf4680bd143e1f3756140a; verdicts persisted to user_feed; API returns llm_* fields ranked by COALESCE; canonical suite 1281 passed/3 skipped; frontend 64/64.
- Source-health evidence for P1 items came from run_uuid 0656b8c0-d333-4e5d-9133-ec8ed17928d9 (2026-06-10 21:37).
- Gemini free tier is quota-dead (429); provider chain degrades to Groq/Cerebras — expected, not a bug.
